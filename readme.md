# Microsoft / Unique Challenge - AI Innovation in Finance
# Hacking the Metrics: Decoding Annual Report Dynamics and Cross-Sector Comparison

Case Introduction:

Problem: Business analysts struggle to extract meaningful insights from extensive annual reports, making sector-wide comparison and trend analysis a cumbersome process.

This challenge is not just a showcase of technical prowess but a crucible for innovative solutions that can reshape how financial analysis is done. We aim to foster ideas that could be integrated into our product roadmap, revolutionizing the way our customers engage with our tools and services. The goal is to create a tool that not only serves UNIQUE AG but also has the potential to be adopted by Microsoft's broader partner and customer base, thereby enhancing the financial analysis ecosystem. 
Our product team is eager to discover new ideas and innovative contributions that could influence our strategic thinking and product development. We look forward to seeing how these insights can shape the future of our offerings and enhance the way customers interact with our technology.

Users of the solution:
* Business analysts and investors seeking comprehensive, comparative insights into company performance for informed decision-making.

## Expected outcome:
Expected Solution: 
* A tool that simplifies the extraction and comparison of key data from annual reports, enabling efficient trend analysis and KPI benchmarking across different companies and sectors.

Participants are expected to present their solutions in a dynamic and engaging format that provides a comprehensive overview of the problem, the proposed solution, and its potential impact. Key elements of the presentation should include:
* High-Level Overview: Clearly articulate the problem being addressed and the innovative approach taken in your solution.
* Live Demo: We strongly encourage showcasing a live demo of your prototype to demonstrate its user interface and key functionalities in action. A live demonstration is much more impactful than walking through code, and it vividly illustrates the practical application
  and effectiveness of your solution.
* Solution's Impact: Discuss how your tool facilitates the extraction and comparison of data from annual reports, its efficiency improvements, and the advantage it offers in market overview and analysis.
